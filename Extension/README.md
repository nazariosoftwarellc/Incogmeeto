# Incogmeeto Extension

This is a small TypeScript project that compiles into a bit of client-side JavaScript. This code automatically hides the view of yourself in the bottom right corner of a Google Meet call.

To build this project, open the app in Xcode and use the Run button. That will call the build scripts to compile this extension.
